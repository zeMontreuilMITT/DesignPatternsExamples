You are writing software for an automated student registration system. 
Which pattern is best applied to each of these scenarios?

- Students are classified within different streams of study from the beginning.
A number of codes are shared between all student IDs, but the same code
indicates different accreditations between different streams.

- Students can gradually add different accreditations as they complete
their studies. Any student can potentially gain any different number of 
accreditations, and different accreditations provide access to later courses
in that stream.

- Students can sign up for a combination of different streams at the start.
Each stream is rigidly defined from start to finish, but students are able to switch
their streams.
